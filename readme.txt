This plugin lets you place a Tweet button on your WordPress blog as a widget and/or using shortcode.

== Description ==

To use the widget just drag it to a sidebar and choose one of three button styles. Up to two Twitter accounts can be specified to recommend, it is advised to at least specify your own Twitter account as the primary Twitter account. You can also specify a url to recommend. If you leave the url empty, the active page will be recommended.

Using shortcode:
From version 1.1 on you can add a Tweet button to your page or post using shortcode.
The simplest version is [tweet/] which will add a button using the title and permalink of the page or post.

To further customize the button you can use the following attributes:
* text: Any text you would like visitors to tweet instead of the current page or post title
* url: Any url you would like visitors to tweet instead of the current page or post permalink

Some examples of correct usage of this shortcode are:
[tweet/]
[tweet text="Check out this page!"/]
[tweet text="Visit WordPress" url="http://www.wordpress.org"/]

== Installation ==

Upload the Tweet Page Social Widget plugin to your blog, activate it and drag the widget to your sidebar. See description on shortcode usage.
